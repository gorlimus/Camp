You can easily post new listings for attractive campsites, leave comments and rates. [Demo](https://my-camp-lm8f3fxfs-gorlimus.vercel.app/)

## Description

I have created a Full Stack application using vanilla **JS** and **Express**, designed to elevate my proficiency in working with the core web technologies such as **HTML**, **CSS**, **JS**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**.

My App is fully operational and packed with exciting features. You can browse through available posts, leave comments, and even rate the content. Furthermore, you can **login/register** and make your own posts, specify their location on an **interactive map**, **upload photos**. All user input is **validated adn sanitized**.

The **CRUD** functionality and **state magement** is fully implemented. I've **seeded content automaticaly** and deployed the app on Vercel, ensuring fast load times and reliable performance.

By working on this project, I have honed my skills in both the user and server-side of the application, gaining valuable insights into how Node.js and MongoDB work.
