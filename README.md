## Description

I created a Full Stack Campsites app using
vanilla JS and Express to get a better understanding of how HTML, CSS and JS work. This project allowed me to improve my skills in working with both the user and server side of the application. I studied in detail how Node.js and MongoDB work in order to prepare the ground for further work with modern frameworks such as React, Vue, Angular.
